# Real-time-Gender-Detection

# INTRODUCTION
Real time gender detection has become a critical component in the new domain of computer human observation and Computer Human Interaction (HCI). Gender detection has numerous applications in the area of recommender systems, focused advertising, security and surveillance. Detection of gender by using the facial features is done by many methods such as Gabor wavelets, artificial neural networks and support vector machine.
In this project, we have used deep learning as a pre-cursor.
